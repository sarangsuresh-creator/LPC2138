This code configures UART0 on the LPC213x microcontroller for interrupt-driven serial communication, where received data is stored in a 4-byte buffer (received_char). The UART0_Init function initializes UART0, enabling FIFOs, setting the baud rate, and configuring the UART0 interrupt in the VIC. The interrupt handler, UART0_InterruptHandler, is triggered on a receive data interrupt, reading up to 4 bytes from the receiver buffer (U0RBR) and storing them in the buffer. In the main loop, when 4 bytes are received (i == 4), they are transmitted back sequentially using the data function, which sends characters through UART0.Here the trigger level is 2 so the RDR will only get cleared on receiving 4 characters.
