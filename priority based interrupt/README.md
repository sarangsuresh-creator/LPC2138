This program demonstrates the configuration and use of two software interrupts with different priorities on the LPC2138 microcontroller to toggle LEDs connected to P0.0 and P0.1. The program defines two interrupt service routines (ISRs): one for a higher-priority software interrupt (IRQ 14) that toggles the LED on P0.0 four times, and another for a lower-priority software interrupt (IRQ 15) that toggles the LED on P0.1 six times. The interrupts are triggered manually from the main loop using the VICSoftInt register. The VIC (Vectored Interrupt Controller) is configured to handle these interrupts, ensuring that the higher-priority interrupt preempts the lower-priority one if both are triggered simultaneously. A simple software delay is used to make the LED toggling visible.
